# TechGrazer

This is a portfolio project, aimed at helping me get my first job as a web developer. The code is for a tech tutorial web site called techgrazer.com. I'm building it to solidify my understanding of the technologies I learned while completing Colt Steele's excellent Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Those technologies include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Passport.js and Heroku. The bootcamp was my first real taste of web development, so much of the code for TechGrazer is adapted from the bootcamp's code-alongs.
