# TechGrazer

This is a portfolio project, aimed at helping me get my first job as a web developer. The code is for a tech tutorial web site called techgrazer.com. I'm building it to solidify my understanding of the technologies I learned while completing Colt Steele's excellent Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Those technologies include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Passport.js and Heroku. The bootcamp was my first real taste of web development, so much of the code for TechGrazer is adapted from the bootcamp's code-alongs.

The tutorials? I'm hoping to write them along the way, in part based on my own learning from building the site, and perhaps partly on past experience as a Linux admin.

Why MongoDB? First and foremost, admittedly, I want to use it again after the bootcamp so it sticks. It also arguably makes sense in the context, which is a CMS for tutorials that don't exist yet, running on a site that built by someone who isn't a web developer yet, meaning it will start out with very basic features and become more sophisticated as I learn. The schema for such a project seems likely to change quite a bit, making a NoSQL database like Mongo a decent option - see e.g. https://medium.com/xplenty-blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference-mysql-vs-mongodb-32c9980e67b2
